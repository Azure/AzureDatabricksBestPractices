// MAGIC %md 
// MAGIC In 2016 HMDA data there were about 7.6 million first-lien home purchase and refinance loans on 1-4 unit properties. NOTE: these numbers are not adjusted for coverage. HMDA does not cover all of the U.S. mortgage market, but the coverage is likely quite high (90% or more) in recent years.
// MAGIC 
// MAGIC About 3.9 million were home purchase and about 3.7 million were refinance loans. In the U.S. mortgage market itâ€™s common to distinguish between conventional and nonconventional loans. Nonconventional loans are loans insured by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA), guaranteed by the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and loans backed by the Farm Service Agency (FSA) or Rural Housing Service (RHS).

// COMMAND ----------

// MAGIC %sql  select a.loan_purpose_name,a.conv,count(*) as total_loans from hmda_lar_clean a group by a.loan_purpose_name,a.conv order by total_loans desc

// COMMAND ----------

// MAGIC %md We see here that while the total mortgage market had slightly more home purchase than refinance loans, conventional mortgages were skewed toward refiance loans.
