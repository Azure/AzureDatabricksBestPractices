# MAGIC ## The Data
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC The data used is public data from Lending Club. It includes all funded loans from 2012 to 2017. Each loan includes applicant information provided by the applicant as well as the current loan status (Current, Late, Fully Paid, etc.) and latest payment information. For a full view of the data please view the data dictionary available [here](https://resources.lendingclub.com/LCDataDictionary.xlsx).

# MAGIC 
# MAGIC These cells showcase streaming and batch concurrent queries (inserts and reads)
# MAGIC * This notebook will run an `INSERT` every 10s against our `loan_stats_delta` table
# MAGIC * We will run two streaming queries concurrently against this data
# MAGIC * Note, you can also use `writeStream` but this version is easier to run in DBCE

# COMMAND ----------

# Read the insertion of data
loan_by_state_readStream = spark.readStream.format("delta").load(DELTALAKE_SILVER_PATH)
loan_by_state_readStream.createOrReplaceTempView("loan_by_state_readStream")

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %sql
# MAGIC select addr_state, sum(`count`) as loans from loan_by_state_readStream group by addr_state

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md **Wait** until the stream is up and running before executing the code below

# COMMAND ----------

import time
i = 1
while i <= 6:
  # Execute Insert statement
  insert_sql = "INSERT INTO loan_by_state_delta VALUES ('IA', 450)"
  spark.sql(insert_sql)
  print('loan_by_state_delta: inserted new row of data, loop: [%s]' % i)
    
  # Loop through
  i = i + 1
  time.sleep(5)

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md 
# MAGIC **Note**: Once the previous cell is finished and the state of Iowa is fully populated in the map (in cell 14), click *Cancel* in Cell 14 to stop the `readStream`.

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC Let's review our current set of loans using our map visualization.

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %sql
# MAGIC -- Review current loans within the `loan_by_state_delta` Delta Lake table
# MAGIC select addr_state, sum(`count`) as loans from loan_by_state_delta group by addr_state

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md Observe that the Iowa (middle state) has the largest number of loans due to the recent stream of data.  Note that the original `loan_by_state_delta` table is updated as we're reading `loan_by_state_readStream`.

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC ##![Delta Lake Logo Tiny](https://pages.databricks.com/rs/094-YMS-629/images/delta-lake-tiny-logo.png) Full DML Support
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC **Note**: Full DML Support is a feature that will be coming soon to Delta Lake; the preview is currently available in Databricks.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC Delta Lake supports standard DML including UPDATE, DELETE and MERGE INTO providing developers more controls to manage their big datasets.

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md Let's start by creating a traditional Parquet table

# COMMAND ----------

# Load new DataFrame based on current Delta table
lbs_df = sql("select * from loan_by_state_delta")

# Save DataFrame to Parquet
lbs_df.write.mode("overwrite").parquet("loan_by_state.parquet")

# Reload Parquet Data
lbs_pq = spark.read.parquet("loan_by_state.parquet")

# Create new table on this parquet data
lbs_pq.createOrReplaceTempView("loan_by_state_pq")

# Review data
display(sql("select * from loan_by_state_pq"))

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md ###![Delta Lake Logo Tiny](https://pages.databricks.com/rs/094-YMS-629/images/delta-lake-tiny-logo.png) DELETE Support
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC The data was originally supposed to be assigned to `WA` state, so let's `DELETE` those values assigned to `IA`

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %sql
# MAGIC -- Attempting to run `DELETE` on the Parquet table
# MAGIC DELETE FROM loan_by_state_pq WHERE addr_state = 'IA'

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md **Note**: This command fails because the `DELETE` statements are not supported in Parquet, but are supported in Delta Lake.

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %sql
# MAGIC -- Running `DELETE` on the Delta Lake table
# MAGIC DELETE FROM loan_by_state_delta WHERE addr_state = 'IA'

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %sql
# MAGIC -- Review current loans within the `loan_by_state_delta` Delta Lake table
# MAGIC select addr_state, sum(`count`) as loans from loan_by_state_delta group by addr_state

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md ###![Delta Lake Logo Tiny](https://pages.databricks.com/rs/094-YMS-629/images/delta-lake-tiny-logo.png) UPDATE Support
# MAGIC The data was originally supposed to be assigned to `WA` state, so let's `UPDATE` those values

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %sql
# MAGIC -- Attempting to run `UPDATE` on the Parquet table
# MAGIC UPDATE loan_by_state_pq SET `count` = 2700 WHERE addr_state = 'WA'

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md **Note**: This command fails because the `UPDATE` statements are not supported in Parquet, but are supported in Delta Lake.

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %sql
# MAGIC -- Running `UPDATE` on the Delta Lake table
# MAGIC UPDATE loan_by_state_delta SET `count` = 2700 WHERE addr_state = 'WA'

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %sql

# MAGIC 
# MAGIC #### INSERT or UPDATE parquet: 7-step process
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC With a legacy data pipeline, to insert or update a table, you must:
# MAGIC 1. Identify the new rows to be inserted
# MAGIC 2. Identify the rows that will be replaced (i.e. updated)
# MAGIC 3. Identify all of the rows that are not impacted by the insert or update
# MAGIC 4. Create a new temp based on all three insert statements
# MAGIC 5. Delete the original table (and all of those associated files)
# MAGIC 6. "Rename" the temp table back to the original table name
# MAGIC 7. Drop the temp table
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC ![](https://pages.databricks.com/rs/094-YMS-629/images/merge-into-legacy.gif)
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC #### INSERT or UPDATE with Delta Lake
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC 2-step process: 
# MAGIC 1. Identify rows to insert or update
# MAGIC 2. Use `MERGE`

# COMMAND ----------

# Let's create a simple table to merge
items = [('IA', 0), ('CA', 2500), ('OR', 0)]
cols = ['addr_state', 'count']
merge_table = spark.createDataFrame(items, cols)
merge_table.createOrReplaceTempView("merge_table")
display(merge_table)

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md Instead of writing separate `INSERT` and `UPDATE` statements, we can use a `MERGE` statement. 

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %sql
# MAGIC MERGE INTO loan_by_state_delta as d
# MAGIC USING merge_table as m
# MAGIC on d.addr_state = m.addr_state
# MAGIC WHEN MATCHED THEN 
# MAGIC   UPDATE SET *
# MAGIC WHEN NOT MATCHED 
# MAGIC   THEN INSERT *

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %sql
# MAGIC -- Review current loans within the `loan_by_state_delta` Delta Lake table
# MAGIC select addr_state, sum(`count`) as loans from loan_by_state_delta group by addr_state

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC ##![Delta Lake Logo Tiny](https://pages.databricks.com/rs/094-YMS-629/images/delta-lake-tiny-logo.png) Schema Evolution
# MAGIC With the `mergeSchema` option, you can evolve your Delta Lake table schema

# COMMAND ----------

# Generate new loans with dollar amounts 
loans = sql("select addr_state, cast(rand(10)*count as bigint) as count, cast(rand(10) * 10000 * count as double) as amount from loan_by_state_delta")
display(loans)

# COMMAND ----------

# Let's write this data out to our Delta table
loans.write.format("delta").mode("append").save(DELTALAKE_SILVER_PATH)

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md **Note**: This command fails because the schema of our new data does not match the schema of our original data

# COMMAND ----------

# Add the mergeSchema option
loans.write.option("mergeSchema","true").format("delta").mode("append").save(DELTALAKE_SILVER_PATH)

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md **Note**: With the `mergeSchema` option, we can merge these different schemas together.

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %sql
# MAGIC -- Review current loans within the `loan_by_state_delta` Delta Lake table
# MAGIC select addr_state, sum(`amount`) as amount from loan_by_state_delta group by addr_state order by sum(`amount`) desc limit 10

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC Databricks Delta’s time travel capabilities simplify building data pipelines for the following use cases. 
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC * Audit Data Changes
# MAGIC * Reproduce experiments & reports
# MAGIC * Rollbacks
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC As you write into a Delta table or directory, every operation is automatically versioned.
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC You can query by:
# MAGIC 1. Using a timestamp
# MAGIC 1. Using a version number
# MAGIC 
# MAGIC using Python, Scala, and/or Scala syntax; for these examples we will use the SQL syntax.
